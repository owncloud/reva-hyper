  As a user
  I want to create auth-app Tokens
  So that I can use 3rd party apps

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes


  Scenario: user creates auth-app token
    When user "Alice" creates app token with expiration time "72h" using the auth-app API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the JSON data of the response should match
