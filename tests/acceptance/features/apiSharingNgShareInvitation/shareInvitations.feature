Feature: Send a sharing invitations
  As the owner of a resource
  I want to be able to send invitations to other users
  So that they can have access to it

  https://owncloud.dev/libre-graph-api/#/drives.permissions/Invite

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |


  Scenario Outline: send share invitation to user with different roles
    Given user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "to share" to "/textfile1.txt"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "FolderToShare"
    When user "Alice" sends the following resource share invitation using the Graph API:
      | resource        | <resource>         |
      | space           | Personal           |
      | sharee          | Brian              |
      | shareType       | user               |
      | permissionsRole | <permissions-role> |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And user "Brian" should have a share "<resource>" shared by user "Alice" from space "Personal"
    And the JSON data of the response should match
